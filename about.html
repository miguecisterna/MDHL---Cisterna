                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mighty Ducks Hockey League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing
                        Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a
                        member of MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside
                        neighborhood. MDHL is ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of
                        parents and previous league members.</p>
